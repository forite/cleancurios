# Clean Curios
## Addon for Curios API (Forge 1.20.1)

Cleaner GUI for Curios API. 

Removes the Curios Screen toggle button and has them always visible.

Removes the Render Toggle buttons from Curio slots.

Visually integrates Curios into the main inventory.

Special Behavior for 5-7 Curio Slots: Some slots appear above the offhand slot.

## For People that are not me:

This was made for a future potential modpack of mine. As such, I am unfortunately not really up for maintaining this mod outside of the version I choose to use for the modpack
(which is 1.20.1 as of now). Furthermore, outside of issues with the current mod, I am not open to adding feature requests. Ideally, the base mod would offer configuration options
to emulate what this addon implements, but since it does not, this addon exists.

I realize this is pretty inflexible of me, so I apologize. Perhaps these changes might fare well in the base mod, which I believe is actively maintained.

You CAN still add issues here for non-feature requests and I WILL maintain those.
